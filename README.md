### Project Overview

 We'll be working with a csv file that contains weather data for each hour in 2012. There are many interesting connections between everyday life and the weather that we will explore with the help of this dataset. Apply all the numpy and pandas skills learned so far to analyze the data.


### Learnings from the project

 Working with Pandas and Numpy functions:
1. Conditional Filtering
2. To DateTime Conversion
3. Pivot Table
4. Groupby Function 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 After reading the csv file, dataframe is manipulated with functions in pandas and numpy library. Straight-forward approach is carried out to sort out the requirements.


### Challenges faced

 I have faced problem with 'Date\Time' feature present in the dataframe to group by the months, unless I got to know the to_datetime conversion function presence.


### Additional pointers

 Most of the basics functions of pandas and numpy library are used in the project.
